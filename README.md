* Sudoku is a logic based, combinational number-placement puzzle game.
* It is meant to be played by 1 player.
* The objective is the fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1-9 so that each column, row and each of the nine 3x3 grids in the 9x9 grid hold values all values from 1 to 9. This means a single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column or 3x3 sub-grid. This also means a completed sudoku puzzle will be a 'Latin square'
* To begin the game the puzzle is partially completed for the player to have a starting point where they are able to find a few correct spots based on the already filled spaces.
* The game is completed when the player has filled in all of the empty spaces in the 9x9 grid. They then need to find out if they are correct. There are many ways for the player to find out if they are correct, such as solution manuals or solution validators.
